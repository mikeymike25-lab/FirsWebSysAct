   <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>Hi! I'm Mike Angelo P. Salamat, a 19-year-old student currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I’m passionate about web development and constantly eager to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and other technologies.

I began learning more about websites through a school project last semester, and since then, I’ve spent my free time creating random websites to sharpen my design and coding abilities.

Aside from coding, I enjoy playing online games, working out, and traveling. These hobbies help keep me creative and motivated in everything I do.

I’m excited to continue growing in this field, and I look forward to turning my ideas into useful and visually appealing digital experiences.</p>
